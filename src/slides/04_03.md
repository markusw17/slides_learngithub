# GitHub Gists

> >

If you have a GitHub account, you also have access to this cool feature called gists. They let you share your code snippets with others. 

Gists exist both inside GitHub as well as through the gist homepage at gist.github.com. 

Let's go to the site and see what it's like to create a gist.

To create a gist, you simply start by filling out this form, create an optional description and then type or past some code.

You give it a filename and an extension here. That's important because it will help with the syntax hihglights.

Let's paste some code from our page, I'll say the naviation.

Down here, you can set your gist to be public or secret.

At the top you can see your latest gists.

You can create public and secret gists. Let's go ahead and make that.

Your gists can consist of more than one file. So if you want to you can add additional files down here. 

If you click on view your gists, you can take a look at the gists you've created. notice that this is tied to your github account.


When you look at a gist, you have options to edit the gist, delete it, get notifications about updates or star the gist, which you can find in the list we saw earlier.

If you're looking at someone else's gist, you can fork it, which will create your own copy and give them credit as well.

You can also download the zip file of the gist if you want to.

On the left, you can see a list of revisions which will show you how the gist may have changed over tieme.

You can also leave comments on gists. 

If you go back to GitHub,you'll notice that gists can also be pinned and you can navigate to them from your profile icon as well.

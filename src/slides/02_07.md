# GitHub Repo Essentials

> >

There are a number of important files that are a great idea to add to GitHub repos. Let's take a look at them.

---

# README.md

- Purpose
- Homepage
- `root`, `docs` or `.github`
- Table of Contents

> >

A readme file tells people what the project does and why it's useful. 

When you go to a repository it's the file that shows up when viewing the repo, it's sort of the repository's homepage.

The README file can be either in the main folder, the `root` of the repo, but it can also go in the `docs` folder or in a special hidden `.github` folder

If you create headings, then the file will receive an automatic table of contents to allow users to jump to different sections.

The headings will also get links when you hover over them to allow you to link to those headings directly.

Public repositories are used to share open source software, but for it to really count, you need to define how others can use, change and distribute the software for that, you create a license file.

There are many types and GitHub has some of the templates, which you can access when you create a repo.

On top of the README, there's a section where you can look at and add some of these special files with some buit in templates for popular ones.

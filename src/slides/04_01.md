# GitHub Discussions

> >

Discussions are a way to encourage conversations about your code that are not necessarily related to fixing code.

# Discussions Features

- Based on issues
- [Threaded conversations](https://github.com/features/discussions)
- Convert to issues

This used to happen a lot within issues, people would discuss all types of things that weren't really problems with the code, which is what issues was originally designed to deal with, so GitHub broke this out and added it's own features.

Like with Issues, Discussions are threaded conversations that offer the rich power of GitHub existing messaging tools.

If you find that a conversation offers a unique idea that should be turned into a feature, you can turn discussions into issues easily.

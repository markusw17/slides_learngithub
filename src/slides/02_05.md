# Learning Markdown

> > >

Developers and writers often use a language called markdown to write content and you'll find it often in many GitHub Repos. Let's take a look at the basics of that format and how it works.

To play with this, we can go to this URL, or really any repo on GitHub and hit the period.

This will open up a visual studio code editor in the cloud and let you play around with it. This editor has a built in markdonw preview, which you can get to by using the icon on the top right.

Let's go through the basics.

# Syntax: Headings

```md
# Headline Level 1
Also Headline Level 1
=

## Headline Level 2
Also Headline Level 2
-

### Headline Level 3
#### Headline Level 4
##### Headline Level 5
###### Headline Level 6
```

> >

You can easily create headlines by using hashtags at the beginning of a sentence.

The number of hashtags correspond to the level of the headline. Markdown usually converts to HTML, so the headline levels correspond to their HTML equivalents and can go up to level 6

Markdown is designed to be easy to read, so there are two alternative versions of the headline level 1 and two. You can use an equal sign right underneath some text for a headline level one and dashes for headline level 2. That makes the headlines easy to read.

# Special Styles

```md
      **bold**
      __bold__

      *italic*
      _italic_

      ~~strike through~~

      > Quotation

      --- Horizontal Rule
      *** Asterisks
      ___ Underscores

```

> >

You can format text by using asterisks or underlines. If you add one set, then the text is italicized, if you add two, then its bolded.

You can also create horizontal rules by using three dashes on lines by themselves.

Also notice that extra carriage returns are generally don't affect the final render of the code, so feel free to use it for formatting.

# Lists

```md
- Hyphens
* Asterisks
+ Plus sign

1. First ordered list item
   * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Numbers don't really matter

```

> >

You can create lists with hyphens, asterisks or plus signs. If you use different prexixes, they will act as separate lists.

You can also use numbers to create ordered lists, Now the numbers don't actually matter, so I'll often use the number one it converts to the proper number automatically.

You can add three spaces to indent an item and include either new lists or paragraphs.

# Links

```md
https://www.linkedin.com

[Website](https://www.linkedin.com "LinkedIn")

[LinkedIn]

[Learning][1]

[linkedin]: https://www.linkedin.com
[1]: https://www.linkedin.com/learning

```

> >

Let's take a look at links next.

When you create a link with the protocol prefix like http, or https, it will be converted into links. It also recognizes email address by the way.

As a matter of fact, markdown can also handle regular HTML tags, so it's quite flexible. In GitHub markdown, most simple tags will work but more complex things like embed links won't.

The links don't have to point to external sites, they can be references to other pages in the repo, so you can just include the filename or the path to the file.

You can create a the link reference in brackets and then the actual link in parentesis. You can even include a title fo the link by putting it in the parenthesis under quotes.

You can use the reference by itself and then refer to it later to tie to to the URL. Some people like to do this so they put all the actual links at the bottom of the page.

You can use a double set of brackets where the second brackets are the reference  and the first is the text. some people use numbers as the reference IDs.

# Images

```

Images are just links with an exclamation point at the beginning.

Link reference notation still works

If you need an image that's linked, it's the same as putting an image that goes where the text of a link would normally go.

Of course you can just use an HTML IMG tag as well.

# Code

inline `console.log(x)` code

```js
let x = 5;
console.log(x)
```

> >

Code is handled using tickmarks. For inline code you can just wrap some code with tickmarks.

You can indent with two tabs or four spaces at the beginning of a line and it will go in a code block.

You can also use fenced code blocks, and then you don't need to indent the code. Usually the tool using the markdown will automatically detect the type of code you have in there, or you can use a language hint on the top tickmarks.

# Organizing Projects

Github provides a lot of tools to help you manage projects. Let's take a look at how they work.

# Inviting Others

> >

First, we're going to invite someone else to participate in this project. My friend Terry Dactill is a great programmer who'd be an asset to this project. I'm going to go over to the settings tab and click on the Invite a Collaborator button.

This will send Terry an email with a link to the project page. It's really just a link to the project.

Let's take a look at that from Terry's perspective.

When I go to github I can accept the invitation and start looking around the project.

# Creating an Issue

Let's go back into my account and create an issue for this project. Now that Terry is part of the team. I'm going to ask for a review of what I've done so far.

I'll also add a label of Help Wanted. Labels can help you organize your project and when you're searching.

In Terry's account, I'm noticing there's a new issue. He looked at the site and noticed that we only changed the title of the index page.

So, Terry created a new issue for this.

I'll see that issue and I'll comment on it.

# Organizing into MileStones

Once you have a lot of issues, things can get messy in the issues tab. You can create milestones to help you filter or organize your issues. Just type in an issue name.

# Creating a Project

I'm noticing that there is quite a bit of activity going on the site, so that's a good time to create a project.

# Managing Files

> >

Now that you understands files and states, let's take a look at a few other features that are important when working with files.

---

# Deleting Files

> >

One thing that you'll do often is delete files from your project. There's two ways you can do this. First is the obvious just deleting the files from the desktop.

Let's make sure that you stage and commit the files.

Now, you can delete the files from VS Code, and take a look at the log.

```
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    LICENSE

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

This sounds odd, but because a deletion is a file change, it shows up as a change in the log. You have to treat it like any other change to your document.

To get this deletion accepted, you'd have to stage then commit the deletion.

You can also use the restore to undo the deletion. Let's try to restore the file.

```
git restore .
```

There's another command that's a bit quicker called git rm.

```
git rm LICENSE
```

The difference is it both deletes the file and stages it, so it saves you one step. Although it's a bit quicker, I almost never remember to use it.

I don't actually want to delete the file, so let's set it back.

```
git restore -S . && git restore .
```

If you're using linux commands you can use the two ampersands to combine commands.

# Renaming Files

> >

Similar to deleting files, you can rename files in a couple of different ways. First, you can simply rename them in operating system you're in.

```
git status
```

Git is going to notice that you've done that in a sort of strange way. It's going to think that you technically deleted one file and then created a new file.

```
git add .
```

However if you stage the files, you'll notice that it will recognize that you've renamed the file. Git is pretty smart about this. Let's go ahead and undo what we've done here.

````

Undoing this rename is a bit harder. You can unstage the files, but at some point git will try to keep both two copies of the files.

However, there's a cleaner way to do this...just like with delete we have a command to take care of renaming.

```sh
git mv index.html home.html
````

# Shortcuts

You can store shortcuts so that you can use them later.

```sh
git config --global alias.C '!git add . && git commit'
git C -m "Adding and Committing Files"


git config --global --unset alias.C # remove shortcuts
```

To do that, we start by issuing a config command like we did when we set the name and email for our account, but you add a variable to an alias element and then in quotes, you add what you want to do.

So for example, I'm creating an alias called C that will issue a `git add .` as well as a git commit. Notice the extra exclamation point before the git keyword as well as the fact that I'm not including a message here. On a PC you might need to use double quotes.

When i call it I use git C and pass along the message flat.

If I want to get rid of this you can call the config command with the unset option and pass along the name of your variable.

---

# Differences

Git can also show you the differences between two states of your files. That can be real useful when you're working on a project. Let's make a change to one of our files.

Now we can issue the diff command.

```sh
git diff
```

You'll get a report of the differences between the current state modifications and the files in the working state.

---

## Using Visual Studio Code

This is also a place where your editor might be able to help. Visual Studio Code has a built in diff feature that makes it a bit more useful. The command line in the terminal isn't as friendly.

---

## Diffing Other Files

Diff is pretty flexible. You can use it to compare all types of things. So, for example, you can compare a file to it's state at any of your other commits.

```sh
git log --oneline
```

You'll get a list of the commits in a single line.

```sh
c815dda (HEAD -> main) Added license and readme
aea989a First Commit
```

This will list the changes from the other commit. Diffing will get even more useful when you compare against different branches.

You can perform visual diffs more easily in Visual Studio code. CLick on the Source Control tab. You can see the changes between files side by side. You can also discard the changes or stage them right from this interface.

And of course, then you can unstage them and discard them.

# Ignoring Files

Github is great at tracking files, but you don't always want to track everything. You could have some files with passwords or other sensitive information that you don't want to share with others.

Or, you could want to add some notes that you don't need to share.

For that, you can create a `.gitignore` file. Inside that file, you can add any type of file or pattern that you want to ignore.

Some common things that might go in there are `.DS_Store`, which is an invisible file Mac OS creates inside folders to keep track of files there.

Another common one is a file called `node_modules`. This is create by npm when working on web projects.

`.vscode/` is a folder with VS Code settings. Every user can have their own settings, so you don't usually want to share those.

You can also create a special extension for adding notes to a project that won't be tracked or shared.

Finally, you can add files that have special passwords or other authentication files in them.

```
.DS_Store
node_modules
.vscode/
notes
**/*-todo.md
authentication.js
```

If you're going to be using the same ignore files in many project, you can also add this as a config variable pointing to a file.

```
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
```

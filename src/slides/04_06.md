# GitHub Wikis

> > >

Wiki's give you the absolute fastest way to create simple documentation on GitHub. It's a pretty interesting option two, since it's a special type of repo, attached to another repo.

Let's get right into it. I'm going to create a home page for my Wiki.

Let's create a second page. We'll call this about page and fill out some text.

Notice that we immediate get a navigation that's easy to go to and from. If your wiki is getting sort of big, you can also search for pages right here.

You can add some custom content on the sidebar for each page.

I can create a footer that appears in every page.

I can also take a peek at the revisions for the Wiki at the top of each page.

The Wiki is just a repository that is attached to your project, so just like with a regular repo, you can clone it locally and interact with it.

Finally, there's a place where you can control the settings for a wiki. You can go to your repository and choose settings, then under General, scroll down to Wikis.

You have the option to allow not just collaborators, but everyone to edit your wiki...in that way it can be more community built, although that sounds dangerous.

If you no longer want the Wiki to appear, you can turn off the feature in here as well.
